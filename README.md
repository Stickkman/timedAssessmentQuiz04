# Timed Assessment Quiz


## Description

This web application is a multiple choice coding quiz that was created to help improve your coding knowledge.  It keeps track of your previous score and name so you can gauge how well you are improving over time.  It can also be used to practice for test questions you might face in interviews, as well as just for trying to improve upon your current knowledge and see how much information you are retaining. This is a timed quiz to simulate so pressure you might face in the real world and for every answer you get wrong time is deducted.

## Usage

Once the site is loaded, simply press the 'Start Quiz' button, then a 60 second timer will start.  There are a total of 5 questions all multiple choice.  For each wrong answer time will be deducted from the clock.  You will also be alerted if your answer is correct or not.  When the timer reaches zero or you have answered all the questions the game will end.  You will then be presented with your final score (20 points for each question), and given the opportunity to enter your name.  Once this is done, click the button to save your name and score, which will lead to the highscores screen.  From here you can go back to retry the quiz, or clear the scores.  Enjoy.
